# **Recap**
This workshop covered
* why to use Python for data analysis,
* basic Python commands and data structure,
* working with data frames.

Our goal is to **begin** to understand and use Python. You are not expected be an expert by now. You probably not even feel very comfortable using Python. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Python takes practice. Check the following resurces to build your skills to the next level:
* [Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
* [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book.php)
