## Welcome to Introduction to Python for Data Analysis (Beginner)

This workshop is an orientation intended for **beginners** who have little to no experience with Python and using Python for data analysis.

See the UBC library Research Commons [event calendar](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/events/) for related workshops on intermediate and advanced topics.
